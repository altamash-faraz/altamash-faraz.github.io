## How to Update Your Resume Later

If you need to update your resume:

### Step 1: Upload Resume to Google Drive
1. Upload your resume PDF to Google Drive
2. Right-click on the file and select "Get link"
3. Set permission to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Copy the share link

### Step 2: Extract File ID
The share link will look like this:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0/view?usp=sharing
```

The FILE_ID is the part between `/d/` and `/view`: `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0`

### Step 3: Update JavaScript
Open `app.js` and find these lines around line 625:
```javascript
const resumeViewUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_RESUME_FILE_ID/view';
const resumeDownloadUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_RESUME_FILE_ID';
```

Replace `YOUR_RESUME_FILE_ID` with your actual file ID:
```javascript
const resumeViewUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0/view';
const resumeDownloadUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0';
```

### Step 4: Test the Functionality
